# Compleasm plots for VGP Phase I genomes

Compleasm run in `busco` mode with the `vertebrata_odb10` database. In the tables, `Frameshift_compleasm` corresponds to the number of identified genes which contain at least one frameshift event, counted once per gene in the case of duplicated BUSCOs.

Compleasm v0.2.6 was run on all VGP phase I, DNAZoo and Zoonomia genomes as follows:

`compleasm_kit/compleasm.py run -t12 -l vertebrata -o ncbi_dataset/data/${f}/${f}.compleasm -a ncbi_dataset/data/${f}/*fna`
