An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x and mis-joins broken using break10x. After using the PacBio data to gap fill with PBJelly and polish with Arrow, the assembly was polished again using the 10X Illumina data and freebayes. Finally, the assembly was further manually curated using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano data and Arima Hi-C data. This was the initial fAnaTes1.1 assembly. An updated fAnaTes1.2 assembly has been further curated to removed duplicate haplotypes using purge_haplotigs and using the Hi-C data to identify further breaks and joins and produce chromosomal-level scaffolds. fAnaTes1.3 includes a mitochondrial assembly produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP.

Swifts, which are the closest relatives to hummingbirds, are highly aerial, insectivorous birds that appear boomerang-shaped in flight. During the 10-month non-breeding season, common swifts fly constantly and presumably even sleep while flying; a study that equipped swifts with data loggers documented over 300 days of continual motion in some individuals. Blood and tissue samples were collected by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology from an injured adult individual that had been tended to by a wildlife rehabilitator. It had been found after a stormy day in Munich in late May 2017, a few weeks after the return of most swifts to their European breeding grounds after wintering in Africa. Common swifts breed in many cities, and growing public awareness and conservation efforts help protect preferred nesting places, often under the eves of old buildings.","organism":{"organism_name":"Apus apus","tax_id":8895},"title":"Animal sample from Apus apus (common swift) for VGP reference genome"},"dev_stage":"adult","geo_loc_name":"Germany:Tutzing","isolate":"bApuApu2","last_updated":"2023-07-21T17:53:19.040","lat_lon":"47.969789 N 11.297823 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publication_date":"2021-10-29T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Apus apus (commonswift) for VGP reference genome"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18391197"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2021-10-29T14:25:03.742"},"submission_date":"2021-10-29T14:25:03.743","tissue":"Blood, muscle"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_020740795.1","paired_assembly":{"accession":"GCA_020740795.1","only_refseq":"chromosome MT","refseq_genbank_are_different":true,"status":"current"},"refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2021-11-04","sequencing_tech":"PacBio Sequel I CLR; Bionano Genomics DLS; Arima Genomics Hi-C; 10X Genomics linked reads","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"1098613695","contig_l50":13,"contig_n50":25561769,"gc_count":"460907973","gc_percent":42,"genome_coverage":"103.36","number_of_component_sequences":109,"number_of_contigs":365,"number_of_organelles":1,"number_of_scaffolds":109,"scaffold_l50":4,"scaffold_n50":115508478,"total_number_of_chromosomes":31,"total_sequence_length":"1100361224","total_ungapped_length":"1098613695"},"current_accession":"GCF_020740795.1","organelle_info":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project","total_seq_length":"17037"}],"organism":{"common_name":"common swift","infraspecific_names":{"isolate":"bApuApu2","sex":"female"},"organism_name":"Apus apus","tax_id":8895},"paired_accession":"GCA_020740795.1","source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAJGQY000000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAJGQY01","wgs_project_accession":"JAJGQY01"}}

These samples were collected from a male and his parents in a laboratory colony of Huishi Toh and James Thomson at University of California, Santa Barbara, and used to generate chromosomal level reference assembly as part of the G10K-VGP project.","organism":{"organism_name":"Arvicanthis niloticus","tax_id":61156},"title":"Animal sample from Arvicanthis niloticus"},"dev_stage":"adult","geo_loc_name":"USA: Santa Barbara","isolate":"mArvNil1","last_updated":"2023-08-23T11:08:19.267","lat_lon":"34.41938 N 119.69905 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publication_date":"2019-08-20T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Nile rat tissue for G10K-VGP trio reference genome child"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS18698935"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2019-08-20T19:29:05.309"},"submission_date":"2019-08-20T19:29:05.307","tissue":"Spleen (genome), brain \u0026 testis (transcriptome)"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_011762505.3","comments":"This is the trio assembly merged haplotype data.

It flocks in large groups with other duck species on larger lakes and is therefore a target of avian influenza epidemiologists. In 2016/2017 the tufted duck was one of the main victim species of a large outbreak of avian influenza in wild birds, particularly in Europe. Several research groups hope to find clues about the differences in avian influenza susceptibility among duck species in wild populations. This sample is from an experimental group that was studied for their detailed responses to avian influenza infection by a consortium of Swedish (Mahmoud Naguib, Patrik Ellstrom, Josef Jarhult), German (Ralf Muller, Elinor Jax, Robert Kraus), Scottish (Jacqueline Smith, Lel Eory, Richard Kuo and Amanda Warr) and Danish researchers among others.

With likely fewer than 100 individuals remaining, Rice's whales are one of the most endangered whales in the world. Recovery of the species depends upon the protection of each remaining whale. The Rice's whale has been consistently located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, along the continental shelf break between 100 and about 400 meters depth. They are the only resident baleen whale in the Gulf of Mexico and are most closely related to Bryde's (pronounced \"broodus\") whales. In 2021, scientists determined that the Rice's whale was a unique species, genetically and morphologically distinct from Bryde's whales. This sample was collected from a beach-stranded calf in 2006 and frozen in the National Marine Mammal Tissue Bank (NIST), originally identified as Bryde's whale, then re-classified as Rice's whale based on genetic analysis and geographic location after the Rice's whale species was described. The sample was used and coordinated by Phil Morin to generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.

After using the PacBio data to gap fill with PBJelly and polish with Arrow, the assembly was polished again using the fBetSpl5 Illumina data and freebayes. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano data.

Cephalochordata is divided into three genera (Asymmetron, Epigonichthys, and Branchiostoma) encompassing at least 35 species. Currently considered the most basal group within the chordate lineage, the amphioxus Branchiostoma lanceolatum shares several key characteristics with vertebrates. These include a dorsal nerve cord, notochord, segmental muscles, perforated pharynx with gill slit, a post anal tail, and homolog of the pronephric kidney, and vertebrate adenohypophysis and thyroid gland. Amphioxus is widely distributed in sandy habitats of tropical and temperate seas, where it spends most of its lives buried in the sea floor. The embryonic and larval stages of amphioxus are planktonic, while the adults are benthic. Amphioxus is gonochoristic with distinct male and female animals, and the spawning season varies between species. Adult amphioxus with mature gonads can be artificially induced to spawn in the laboratory to achieve in vitro fertilization. Morphological distinctions among adults from various amphioxus species can be made by evaluating general body symmetry. Additionally, comparisons of the total count of muscle segments, dorsal and anal fin chambers, and pharyngeal slits serve as distinguishing factors. Over the last decades, amphioxus has emerged as a valuable model organism for developmental and evolutionary studies, and comparative genomics. Molecular and genomic studies have highlighted that amphioxus genome closely mirrors that of vertebrates, exhibiting similarity in both gene family content and genomic linkage. However, a crucial distinction lies in the fact that the amphioxus genome has not undergone the two rounds of whole-genome duplication commonly observed in vertebrate genomes. Therefore, the morphological and genomic simplicity of cephalochordates, in comparison to vertebrates, makes amphioxus an attractive model for studying chordate biology and gaining insights into the origin and evolution of vertebrates.","organism":{"organism_name":"Branchiostoma lanceolatum","tax_id":7740},"title":"Animal sample from Branchiostoma lanceolatum (European lancelet) for VGP reference genome, klBraLanc5"},"dev_stage":"adult","geo_loc_name":"Italy","isolate":"klBraLanc5","last_updated":"2023-11-22T13:58:05.101","lat_lon":"44.4137 N 8.9289 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publication_date":"2023-11-22T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Branchiostoma lanceolatum (European lancelet) for VGP reference genome, klBraLanc5"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-11-22T13:58:05.101"},"submission_date":"2023-11-22T13:58:05.101","tissue":"whole body"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_035083965.1","paired_assembly":{"accession":"GCA_035083965.1","only_refseq":"chromosome MT","refseq_genbank_are_different":true,"status":"current"},"refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2024-01-05","sequencing_tech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"458272016","contig_l50":16,"contig_n50":11195901,"gc_count":"190665694","gc_percent":41.5,"genome_coverage":"87.25","number_of_component_sequences":34,"number_of_contigs":137,"number_of_organelles":1,"number_of_scaffolds":34,"scaffold_l50":8,"scaffold_n50":22634557,"total_number_of_chromosomes":19,"total_sequence_length":"458287516","total_ungapped_length":"458272016"},"current_accession":"GCF_035083965.1","organelle_info":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project","total_seq_length":"15076"}],"organism":{"common_name":"amphioxus","infraspecific_names":{"isolate":"klBraLanc5","sex":"female"},"organism_name":"Branchiostoma lanceolatum","tax_id":7740},"paired_accession":"GCA_035083965.1","source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAXKVS000000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAXKVS01","wgs_project_accession":"JAXKVS01"}}

Males of this species form long-term cooperative alliances and display together to attract females, but only the dominant alpha member of each pair usually mates. Subordinate beta males participate closely in displays, but benefit through increased chances of becoming an alpha in future years. Males compete for alpha positions, and after male status is established, females make mate choices by flying among dispersed alpha display territories. Displays are acrobatic and complex. Their song repertoire is diverse for a suboscine and includes male-male duets by alpha-beta partners. Adults can live up to 18 years. Females raise chicks outside of mates display areas and without male assistance, and tracking via video and telemetry has been used to recreate the process of mate choice and test hypotheses about how and why females choose the mates they do. Archived samples from one population monitored for 20+ years are available for questions requiring known relationships among individuals, and longitudinal data on individual genetic reproductive success. This sample of an adult female from Isla Boca Brava, Republic of Panama, was collected by Emily DuVal following an incidental netting death. The specimen was preserved for detailed genome sequencing as part of the G10K-VGP Project and in affiliation with the NSF RCN#1457541.

An initial PacBio assembly of fDenClu1 was made using Falcon-unzip, and retained haplotigs were identified using purge_haplotigs. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x, then scaffolded further with BioNano hybrid scaffolding and scaffolded further still using the Hi-C data with SALSA2. Polishing and gap-filling of both the primary scaffolds and haplotigs was performed using the PacBio reads and Arrow, followed by two rounds of Illumina polishing using the 10X data and freebayes. The mitochondrial assembly was produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins, improve concordance with the BioNano and Hi-C data and remove retained haplotypic duplication using purge_haplotigs.

The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi. Finally, each haplotype assembly was analysed and manually improved using TreeVal. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data have been named in order of size. This genome has been assembled using PacBio and HiC data and phased. The result is two curated haplotypes. The exact order and orientation of the contigs on chromosome 1 (0 - 18 Mbp) are unknown. The exact order and orientation of the contigs on chromosome 11 (36 - 38.5 Mbp) are unknown.

The dugong spans the waters of some 40 countries and territories throughout the Indo-West Pacific (from Wikipedia entry). This sample is from a female inhabiting Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. The sample was collected by Janet M. Lanyon at the University of Queensland; Pacbio sequence data was generated at the Australian Genome Research Facility in the University of Queensland; Hi-C generated at the Ramaciotti Center for Genomics in the University University of New South Whales; the genome assembled at the Vertebrate Genome Lab at the Rockefeller University; and the curated at the curation team at the Sanger Institute. The genome was generated in part for and contributed to the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). The project was coordinate by Beth Shapiro, Carolyn J. Hogg, Olivier Fedrigo, and Erich D. Jarvis.

Work was done in collaboration with Sara Ord, Eriona Hysolli, and Larissa Souza Arantes. Skin tissue was collected from a 50 years old adult male at the San Diego zoo, California (SB-218, and GAN # 26734787; ZIMS/Species 360) and fibroblast cells were cultured by the Frozen Zoo. The sample was sequenced using the VGP 2.0 individual pipeline at the Rockefeller University Vertebrate Genome Lab, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich Jarvis. The primary haplotype contigs were generated from PacBio Hifi reads, scaffolded with Bionano optical maps, and Arima HiC reads. Genome was assembled by Diego De Panis. Manual curation of chromosomes and other genomic features was conducted by Nadolina Brajuka and led by Giulio Formenti.

It is a small nocturnal terrestrial frog found in Mexico, Central America, and the northeastern regions of South America. The tungara frog exhibits interesting behavior in male/female interactions. Male vocalizations are critical in female mate choice, and females often prefer males who give complex mating calls at a lower frequency rather than simple calls at a higher frequency (from Wikipedia entry). This sample of a female individual (aEngPut4/MGP-1488.2) is part of a trio assembly (mother aEngPut2/MGP-1444.1, father aEngPut3/MGP-1452.1), with Hi-C sequence data from the sister offspring aEngPut1/MGP-1488.1 used for scaffolding. The individuals were bred in captivity and procured by Marcos Gridi-Papp to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP).

Gray whales earned the nickname 'devil fish' because of their aggressive reactions when harpooned. Commercial whaling rapidly brought both Pacific populations to near extinction. International conservation measures were enacted in the 1930s and 1940s to protect whales from over-exploitation, and in the mid-1980s the International Whaling Commission instituted a moratorium on commercial whaling. Gray whales are known for their curiosity toward boats in some locations and are the focus of whale watching and ecotourism along the west coast of North America. Gray whales make one of the longest annual migrations of any mammal, traveling about 10,000 miles round-trip and in some cases upwards of 14,000 miles. On their migration routes they face threats from vessel strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and other sources of disturbance (NOAA website).This tissue sample was collected by dart biopsy at sea under NMFS permit 14097. The sample was cultured and frozen by Susanne Meyer at UCSB, and coordinated by Phil Morin to later generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP).

Two other right whale species exist: the North Pacific right whale, found in the North Pacific Ocean; and the southern right whale, found in the southern hemisphere. Right whales are baleen whales, feeding on copepods (tiny crustaceans) by straining huge volumes of ocean water through their baleen plates, which act like a sieve. By the early 1890s, commercial whalers had hunted North Atlantic right whales to the brink of extinction. They got their name from being the \"right\" whales to hunt because they floated when they were killed. Whaling is no longer a threat, but they have never recovered to pre-whaling numbers, and human interactions still present the greatest danger. Entanglements in fishing gear and vessel strikes are the leading causes of North Atlantic right whale mortality. Increasing ocean noise levels from human activities are also a concern since the noise may interfere with right whale communication and increase their stress levels (NOAA website).

The assembly was made using the Vertebrate Genomes Project v1.5 assembly pipeline on DNAnexus. An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip, and retained haplotigs were identified using purge_haplotigs. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x, then scaffolded further with BioNano hybrid scaffolding and scaffolded further still using the Hi-C data with SALSA2. Polishing and gap-filling of both the primary scaffolds and haplotigs was performed using the PacBio reads and Arrow, followed by two rounds of Illumina polishing using the 10X data and freebayes. The mitochondrial assembly was produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano and Hi-C data.

It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upper parts and a long, deeply forked tail. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \"swallow\" rather than a \"martin\". There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the Northern Hemisphere. Four are strongly migratory, and their wintering grounds cover much of the Southern Hemisphere as far south as central Argentina, the Cape Province of South Africa, and northern Australia. Its huge range means that the barn swallow is not endangered, although there may be local population declines due to specific threats. The barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally uses man-made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup nest from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight. This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration. The barn swallow is the national bird of Austria and Estonia.","organism":{"organism_name":"Hirundo rustica","tax_id":43150},"title":"Muscle sample from Hirundo rustica(bHirRus1) for genome assembly"},"dev_stage":"Adult","geo_loc_name":"Italy","isolate":"bHirRus1","last_updated":"2021-02-28T09:22:09.149","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publication_date":"2020-04-23T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"bHirRus1_Muscle"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS8103732"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2020-04-23T02:20:10.759"},"submission_date":"2020-04-23T02:20:10.756","tissue":"Muscle"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCF_015227805.2","paired_assembly":{"accession":"GCA_015227805.3","status":"current"},"refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2021-11-30","sequencing_tech":"PacBio Sequel I CLR; Illumina NovaSeq; Arima Genomics Hi-C; Bionano Genomics DLS","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"1080421139","contig_l50":100,"contig_n50":2794774,"gc_count":"459659371","gc_percent":42.5,"genome_coverage":"51.15","number_of_component_sequences":617,"number_of_contigs":1719,"number_of_scaffolds":617,"scaffold_l50":5,"scaffold_n50":76187387,"total_number_of_chromosomes":41,"total_sequence_length":"1105955550","total_ungapped_length":"1080421139"},"current_accession":"GCF_015227805.2","organism":{"common_name":"Barn swallow","infraspecific_names":{"isolate":"bHirRus1","sex":"female"},"organism_name":"Hirundo rustica","tax_id":43150},"paired_accession":"GCA_015227805.3","source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_REFSEQ","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JADDRP000000000.3","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JADDRP03","wgs_project_accession":"JADDRP03"}}

Inia is the only genus in the family Iniidae, and there are currently two recognized subspecies (I. g. boliviensis, I. g. geoffrensis). I. geoffrensis is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN (January 2023), due to highly fragmented and declining populations. This sample was obtained from the last remaining captive Amazon River Dolphin in Europe, at the Duisburg Zoo in Duisburg Germany, and named \"Orinoco\" for the region of its origin. Orinoco was also referred to as \"Baby\" at the Duisburg Zoo, because he was captured with his mother and three other individuals in 1975, and transferred to the Duisburg Zoo, where he lived until his death in December, 2020. Samples were collected by Marine Mammal Curator Dr. Kerstin Ternes, DVM, and the sequencing of the genome coordinated by Phil Morin at NOAA and Michael Hiller at the LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics, Senckenberg Research Institute, in collaboration with the Cetacean Genomes Project (CGP).","organism":{"organism_name":"Inia geoffrensis","tax_id":9725},"title":"Animal sample from Inia geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin) for VGP genome, mIniGeo1"},"dev_stage":"adult","geo_loc_name":"Venezuela: Rio Apure","isolate":"mIniGeo1","last_updated":"2024-08-19T14:40:24.890","lat_lon":"7.61889 N 66.40557 W","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publication_date":"2023-01-19T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Inia geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin) for VGP genome, mIniGeo1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22396567"}],"sex":"male","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-19T12:37:04.470"},"submission_date":"2023-01-19T12:37:04.470","tissue":"blood"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_036417435.1","diploid_role":"haplotype_1","linked_assemblies":[{"assembly_type":"haplotype_2","linked_assembly":"GCA_036417475.1"}],"refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2024-02-06","sequencing_tech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Dovetail OmniC","submitter":"Cetaceans Genome Project"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"2749289516","contig_l50":20,"contig_n50":40892022,"gc_count":"1156603452","gc_percent":42,"genome_coverage":"37","number_of_component_sequences":902,"number_of_contigs":1186,"number_of_organelles":1,"number_of_scaffolds":902,"scaffold_l50":9,"scaffold_n50":117431308,"total_number_of_chromosomes":23,"total_sequence_length":"2749345781","total_ungapped_length":"2749289516"},"current_accession":"GCA_036417435.1","organelle_info":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"Cetaceans Genome Project","total_seq_length":"16589"}],"organism":{"common_name":"boutu","infraspecific_names":{"isolate":"mIniGeo1","sex":"male"},"organism_name":"Inia geoffrensis","tax_id":9725},"source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAZAQT000000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAZAQT01","wgs_project_accession":"JAZAQT01"}}

The spermaceti is an oil sac that helps the whales focus sound. Like squid, pygmy sperm whales can produce a dark, ink-like liquid that helps them escape from predators. Pygmy sperm whales are found in temperate and tropical seas worldwide. They look very similar to dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima), making it very difficult to distinguish between the two species in the field. Little is known about both species because of limited information, and they are considered rare. This sample is from a juvenile female that was live-stranded in La Jolla, CA, but died after several weeks of attempted rehabilitation. The tissue sample was sent from Hubbs SeaWorld in San Diego to San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in 2017 in order to establish a fibroblast cell line that was banked in the SDZWA Frozen Zoo. The sample was later provided to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project. Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.

It is a nomadic migrant, and it settles in an area only when there is food available. The species is critically endangered, and the severe predation of introduced sugar gliders (Petaurus breviceps) on breeding females and nests in some locations has demonstrated an unexpected but potentially serious new threat (from Wikipedia entry).

The olive python is often kept as a pet and is bred in captivity. It is technically an advanced-level species due to its size, habitat requirements, and strong feeding response, requiring a terrarium of a minimum of 2.4 metres (8 ft) long, by 1 metre (3 ft) high (from Wikipedia entry). Two subspecies are recognized: L. o. barroni and L. o. olivaceus. This sample is from a female barroni subspecies, in Perth Zoo, Australia, coordinated by Morten E. Allentoft at Curtin University, Perth, and used to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Olivier Fedrigo and Erich D. Jarvis.","organism":{"organism_name":"Liasis olivaceus","tax_id":283338},"title":"Animal sample from Liasis olivaceus (olive python) for VGP reference genome, rLiaOli1"},"dev_stage":"adult","geo_loc_name":"Australia: Perth Zoo, Australia","isolate":"rLiaOli1","last_updated":"2024-08-24T12:18:20.577","lat_lon":"31.9732 S 115.8518 E","models":["Model organism or animal"],"owner":{"contacts":[{}],"name":"G10K"},"package":"Model.organism.animal.1.0","publication_date":"2023-01-14T00:00:00.000","sample_ids":[{"label":"Sample name","value":"Animal sample from Liasis olivaceus (olive python) for VGP genome, rLiaOli1"},{"db":"SRA","value":"SRS22448716"}],"sex":"female","status":{"status":"live","when":"2023-01-14T19:55:04.743"},"submission_date":"2023-01-14T19:55:04.743","tissue":"blood"},"blast_url":"https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch\u0026PROG_DEF=blastn\u0026BLAST_SPEC=GDH_GCA_030867105.1","diploid_role":"haplotype_1","linked_assemblies":[{"assembly_type":"haplotype_2","linked_assembly":"GCA_030867085.1"}],"refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2023-08-24","sequencing_tech":"PacBio Sequel II HiFi; Bionano Genomics DLS; Arima Hi-C v2","submitter":"Vertebrate Genomes Project"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"1485822150","contig_l50":8,"contig_n50":65226870,"gc_count":"597272454","gc_percent":40,"genome_coverage":"33.48","number_of_component_sequences":43,"number_of_contigs":116,"number_of_scaffolds":43,"scaffold_l50":3,"scaffold_n50":203662644,"total_number_of_chromosomes":17,"total_sequence_length":"1486119866","total_ungapped_length":"1485822150"},"current_accession":"GCA_030867105.1","organism":{"infraspecific_names":{"isolate":"rLiaOli1","sex":"female"},"organism_name":"Liasis olivaceus","tax_id":283338},"source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/JAVFJL000000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/JAVFJL01","wgs_project_accession":"JAVFJL01"}}

An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip and the primary contigs extended by merging with a miniasm assembly. The contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x, and using synteny with Lates calcarifer (Asian seabass). After using the PacBio data to gap fill with PBJelly and polish with Arrow, the assembly was polished again using the 10X Illumina data and freebayes. Finally, the assembly was further manually curated using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano and Arima Hi-C data. This was the fMasArm1.1 assembly. A updated fMasArm1.2 assembly has been further curated using the Hi-C data to separate out haplotigs, identify further breaks and joins and produce chromosomal-level scaffolds.

Chromosome-scale scaffolds are named by synteny based on Nyctalus leisleri (lesser noctule) GCA_964264875.1. The order and orientation of contigs along chromosome Y is uncertain between 2.7 Mb and 24 Mb.","refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2025-04-03","sequencing_tech":"PacBio,Arima2","submitter":"WELLCOME SANGER INSTITUTE"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"2226260411","contig_l50":23,"contig_n50":26125689,"gc_count":"958177504","gc_percent":43,"genome_coverage":"46","number_of_component_sequences":584,"number_of_contigs":886,"number_of_organelles":1,"number_of_scaffolds":584,"scaffold_l50":8,"scaffold_n50":95320580,"total_number_of_chromosomes":23,"total_sequence_length":"2226320811","total_ungapped_length":"2226260411"},"current_accession":"GCA_964264875.2","organelle_info":[{"description":"Mitochondrion","submitter":"WELLCOME SANGER INSTITUTE","total_seq_length":"17230"}],"organism":{"common_name":"lesser noctule","organism_name":"Nyctalus leisleri","tax_id":59465},"source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CAXWAE000000000.2","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CAXWAE02","wgs_project_accession":"CAXWAE02"}}

An initial PacBio assembly was made using Falcon-unzip, and retained haplotigs were identified using purge_haplotigs. The primary contigs were then scaffolded using the 10X data with scaff10x, then scaffolded further with BioNano hybrid scaffolding and scaffolded further still using the Hi-C data with SALSA2. Polishing and gap-filling of both the primary scaffolds and haplotigs was performed using the PacBio reads and Arrow, followed by two rounds of Illumina polishing using the 10X data and freebayes. The mitochondrial assembly was produced at The Rockefeller University using mitoVGP. Finally, the assembly was manually improved using gEVAL to correct mis-joins and improve concordance with the BioNano and Hi-C data.

This shark has a long, narrow rostrum. Its first dorsal fin originates behind the tips of the pectoral fins, and its caudal fin is angled almost straight in line with the body. It is found in the northwest Pacific Ocean around Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and northern China over the sandy or muddy bottoms of the continental shelf at depths of 50 to 800 m (160 to 2,620 ft) (from Wikipedia entry). This sample of a male individual born at the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Okinawa, Japan, was collected by Taketeru Tomita and coordinated by Gavin Naylor and Adrian Lee to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Keiichi Sato of the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium facilitated collection of the tissues.

The false killer whale's entire body is black or dark gray, although lighter areas may occur ventrally (on its underside) between the flippers or on the sides of the head. Fishery interactions are one of the main threats facing this species. False killer whales are known to depredate (take fish and bait off of fishing lines), which can lead to hooking and/or entanglement. This is especially a concern for false killer whales that interact with the Hawai'i longline fishery (NOAA website).The tissue sample was sent to the University of California, San Francisco from Cascadia Research Collective in Hawaii in 2019 in order to establish a cell line. The sampled individual is from the pelagic population offshore of Hawai'i. The sample was cultured and frozen by Matthew Schmitz at UCSF and later provided as part of the Cetacean Genomes Project to generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genomes Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Jennifer Balacco, Giulio Formenti, and Erich D. Jarvis.

The North African ostrich (Struthio camelus camelus) is the nominate subspecies of the common ostrich from West and North Africa. It has the largest average size among the subspecies of ostriches, making it the largest living bird (from Wikipedia entries). The cells of this sample are embryonic fibroblasts derived from an HH28 embryo cultured up to 14 days in vitro. The embryo came from eggs shipped from Roaming Acres farm in Lafayette Township, New Jersey. The farm raises ostriches that are a non-pedigreed hybrid of the \"blue-necked\" Somali ostrich (Struthio molybdophanes) and the \"red-necked\" North African sub-species of the common ostrich (Struthio camelus camelus). The sample was procured by Anna Keyte and Matthew Biegler to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), and the cells were incubated at the Rockefeller University.

This sample was collected by Allyson Hindle from an individual bred in captivity at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and coordinated by Ryan Langlois to generate a high-quality reference genome for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP). The sample consists of ~6 million primary dermal fibroblast cells at passage 6, not transformed. The sex was determined to be male based on a spectral kmer plot of the genome assembly. Sequencing and genome assembly were conducted at the Vertebrate Genome Lab (VGL) at the Rockefeller University, led by Erich D.

Milensky in 2005, stored by the Smithsonian Institute. It was further procured by Gary Graves of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C., to generate a high-quality reference for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP).

The assembly process included the following sequence of steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm in Hi-C integrated assembly mode, and Hi-C based scaffolding with YaHS. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using MitoHiFi. Finally, each haplotype assembly was analysed and manually improved using TreeVal. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by the Hi-C data have been named in order of size. Les Christidis' 1990 research on the karyotype of Zosterops lateralis reports a diploid chromosome number of 78. This research is detailed in the book Animal Cytogenetics: Chordata 3B: Aves, published by Gebruder Borntraeger, which examines avian cytogenetics.In our genome assembly, we identified a haploid chromosome count of 39 autosomes plus the Z and W sex chromosomes. It is possible that some chromosome joins are not highlighted by the Hi-C signal or that data for certain joins may be missing, but this cannot be concluded from our assembly.The microchromosomes were identified through second-shot curation of scaffolds smaller than 20 Mbp, combined with homology-based identification using known microchromosome genes via Microfinder.Chromosomes Z and W were identified by copy number in the diploid assembly.Chromosomes Z was identified through synteny analysis with Taeniopygia guttata (GCA_003957565.4).The exact order and orientation of the contigs on chromosome 23 (1,400 - 7,712 Kbp) are unknown.The exact order and orientation of the contigs on chromosome 31 (1,100 - 5,932 Kbp) are unknown.","refseq_category":"reference genome","release_date":"2025-03-28","sequencing_tech":"PacBio,Arima2","submitter":"WELLCOME SANGER INSTITUTE"},"assembly_stats":{"atgc_count":"1047298350","contig_l50":99,"contig_n50":2855402,"gc_count":"445880290","gc_percent":42.5,"genome_coverage":"48","number_of_component_sequences":818,"number_of_contigs":1459,"number_of_scaffolds":818,"scaffold_l50":5,"scaffold_n50":74034074,"total_number_of_chromosomes":39,"total_sequence_length":"1047426550","total_ungapped_length":"1047298350"},"current_accession":"GCA_965231245.1","organism":{"common_name":"silver-eye","organism_name":"Zosterops lateralis","tax_id":43581},"source_database":"SOURCE_DATABASE_GENBANK","wgs_info":{"master_wgs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CBDDMO000000000.1","wgs_contigs_url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/wgs/CBDDMO01","wgs_project_accession":"CBDDMO01"}}
