I downloaded all vertebrate accessions via ncbi datasets and partitioned them like so:
Numbers are (raw/reference) genomes in each category

DNA Zoo (59/37)
All assemblies registered under the DNA Zoo BioProject PRJNA944680
All assemblies with submitter listed as "DNA Zoo" or "DNA Zoo Consortium"

Zoonomia (131/65)
All assemblies registered under the "200 Mammals" BioProject PRJNA312960

B10K (266/226)
All assemblies registered under the B10K BioProject PRJNA545868

CICHLID~X (539/224)
All assemblies registered under the Salzburger Lab BioProject PRJNA550295
This is the group of Walter Salzburger from the University of Basel. Not sure if it should be included

Iridian Genomes (1,507/1,418)
All assemblies with submitter "Iridian Genomes" or "IRIDIAN GENOMES"
From what I can tell, there is no umbrella project for these genomes

VGP (1,360/492)
All assemblies in the VGP BioProject PRJNA489243

EBP (2,186/995)
All assemblies in the EBP BioProject PRJNA533106

EBP Other (415/187)
Assemblies in the EBP BioProject that are not part of B10K, DNA Zoo, VGP or Zoonomia

Vertebrata (11,575/4,765)
All vertebrate assemblies on NCBI

I would suggest restricting the the reference assemblies. I don't know if ~5,000 is too many.

I have included metadata from a set of genomes with "reference" tag namely:

All vertebrate reference genomes from:

Those under the VGP Umbrella BioProject
...DNAZoo
...Zoonomia
...B10K
...EBP projects not in the above BioProjects
...Iridian
...Cichlid~X
